# Enhancement Proposals

Enhancement Proposals are a formal way of proposing large feature additions to the **Django Ninja Framework**.

You can create a proposal by making a pull request with a new page under [`docs/proposals`](https://github.com/vitalik/django-ninja/tree/master/docs/docs/proposals), or by creating an [issue on github](https://github.com/vitalik/django-ninja/issues).

Please see the current proposals:
